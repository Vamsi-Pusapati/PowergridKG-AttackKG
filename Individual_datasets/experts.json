It’s empowering to create safe spaces & celebrate diversity. Developing new leaders. The most valuable lessons I’ve learned have come freely. Looking to pay it forward; if I can make myself obsolete/irrelevant, I’ve done my job. Building out an early-adopter Security Innovator function to evaluate new products, pilot those in prod environments, drive both vendor product & internal operations maturity. Serving on our corporate Product Strategy team to determine new business vertical pursuits and areas of focus, ensuring cybersecurity-by-design is inherent and complementary to overall vision & execution. Evaluating where modern cybersec intersects with critical outcomes like human safety, protection of health/wellness, and diversity & inclusion. Serving as a CISO advisor to the cyber VC community to help evaluate, shape, and focus new products coming to market. Servant leader in an organization annually recognized by People Magazine (Companies That Care), Forbes (Best Places to Work), and Top Places To Work (Top 5 in Healthcare). Building out a data/identity fabric to correlate disparate identities across disparate data stores but map to the same human, solving for areas of the ‘de-identification’ spectrum to protect privacy and empower business. Security macro issues: heavy new tech adoption, under-resourced security workforce, rapid SME requirements for every new tech and its vulnerabilities, and a dynamic threat landscape. Centralizing IAM at scale as a shared service across the enterprise to drive business efficiency and automation."

In addition to providing properly cleared TS/SCI staff, I also assisted in developing the watch's mission and the processes necessary to ensure broad collaboration and coordination, both internally and with other major Federal cyber centers.

Our solution involves deploying a peer on both the device and the cloud, which can be done easily and quickly at scale. With our solution, companies can enjoy the following benefits within minutes of deployment on their on-site devices and cloud instances: • Zero trust security for both devices and cloud • End-to-end encrypted data streaming • Endpoint management • Mitre Att&ck framework • Intrusion detection and response • Real-time SOC compliance."

In this course, instructor Diana Kelley pulls real-world examples from the latest ML research and walks through ways that ML and AI can fail, providing pointers on how to design, build, and maintain resilient systems.\n\nLearn about intentional failures caused by attacks and unintentional failures caused by design flaws and implementation issues. Security threats and privacy risks are serious, but with the right tools and preparation you can set yourself up to reduce them. Diana explains some of the most effective approaches and techniques for building robust and resilient ML, such as dataset hygiene, adversarial training, and access control to APIs."
